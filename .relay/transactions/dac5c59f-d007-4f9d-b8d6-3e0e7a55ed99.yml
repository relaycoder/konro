gitCommitMsg: 'fix(types): export TableState and refactor DatabaseState'
promptSummary: >-
  User reported a TypeScript error: `TableState` is not an exported member of
  `src/types.ts`. This was caused by my previous refactor of `adapter.ts`. I am
  now fixing this by defining and exporting `TableState` in `src/types.ts` and
  refactoring `DatabaseState` to use it, which also makes the types module
  DRYer.
reasoning:
  - >-
    You are absolutely right. My apologies, my previous refactoring of
    `src/adapter.ts` introduced a dependency on a `TableState` type that wasn't
    exported from `src/types.ts`, leading to the compilation error.
  - >-
    To fix this, and to further align with the goal of making the codebase DRY,
    I will introduce the `TableState` type in `src/types.ts`.
  - >-
    1.  **Define `TableState`**: I'll create and export a new `TableState` type
    to represent the structure of a single table's data (`records` and `meta`).
  - >-
    2.  **Refactor `DatabaseState`**: I'll then refactor the existing
    `DatabaseState` type to use `TableState`. This not only fixes the import
    error in `adapter.ts` but also makes the type definitions in `types.ts` more
    modular and reusable.
