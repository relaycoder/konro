0. [README.md](mdc:README.md) is the single source of truth, comply it, do not edit it.
1. while addressing fail tests, always have a mindset that there must be main program core error to fix rather than make test less strict!!
2. Test cases should match expected requirements
3. Do not create any new file for helper,script etc. just do what prompted.
4. test should use/modify test/test.util.ts for reusability
5. using type any and unknown, even casting as is strictly forbidden!!
